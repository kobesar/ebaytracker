# Scrapes price data from eBay

Custom automated scraper that runs everyday to gather pricing data for sold listings of: Tamron 24-70 2.8 G1 Nikon, Nikkor 10-24 3.5-5.6, and Nikone D7200. However, if you want to use this to scrape sold ebay listings of your liking, please do. You will need to change the URL the function takes and possibly the elements that are grabbed by BeautifulSoup (`scrape.py`).
